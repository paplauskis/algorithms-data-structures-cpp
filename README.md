## Implemented data structures and algorithms based on requirements in C++
### Data structures used:
- **Linked List**
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**
- **Stack (as a Linked List)**
- **Queue (as a Linked List)**
- **Dequeue (as a Linked List)**
- **Binary Search Tree**

### Requirements are present in .cpp files

To run the algorithms, paste the code in some online compiler
f.e.: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/
